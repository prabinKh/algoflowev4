## Technical Architecture
AlgoFlow is engineered with a robust and modern technology stack, ensuring high performance, scalability, and maintainability. The decoupled architecture separates concerns, allowing for independent development and scaling of services.

### Backend
- **Django (Python)**: A high-level Python web framework for rapid development and clean design, forming the core of AlgoFlow's API management.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Used for building powerful and flexible APIs, providing token-based authentication and permission handling for various user roles.
- **Celery & Redis**: For asynchronous task processing, enabling features like AI responses and background jobs without impacting user experience. Redis serves as the message broker and result backend.

### Frontend
- **React (Vite)**: A fast and efficient JavaScript library for building user interfaces, coupled with Vite for a lightning-fast development experience.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances code quality and maintainability through static type checking.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

### Database & Infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, feature robustness, and performance. AlgoFlow utilizes PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security (RLS) for stringent data isolation between tenants.
- **AWS S3**: Used for secure and scalable file uploads and storage.
- **Gemini AI**: Integrated for advanced functionalities such as AI-powered customer support and personalized product recommendations.

## Setup Guide
Follow these steps to get AlgoFlow up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose (recommended for local development)
- PostgreSQL (if not using Docker)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prabinKh/algoflowev4.git
cd algoflowev4
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the `backend` directory and install Python dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure your `.env` file (create one from `.env.example` if it exists) with your database settings, AWS S3 credentials, and Gemini AI API key.

Run database migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Start the Django development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal, navigate to the project root (`algoflowev4`), and install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install # or npm install / yarn install
```

Start the React development server:
```bash
pnpm dev # or npm run dev / yarn dev
```

### 4. Celery & Redis (Optional, for full functionality)
For asynchronous tasks and AI features, you'll need Redis and Celery. If using Docker Compose, these will be handled automatically. Otherwise, install Redis and run Celery:

Start Redis server:
```bash
redis-server
```

In a new terminal, start Celery worker:
```bash
celery -A fixitall_backend worker -l info
```
